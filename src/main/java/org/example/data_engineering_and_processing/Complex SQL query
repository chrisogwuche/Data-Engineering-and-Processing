Assuming you have Two Tables in the database called users and phones
And there is a field called user_id in the Phones table which is a foreign key
referencing to a primary key called id in the users table.

In the users table, there are fields called; id and name
In the phones table, there are fields called; id, user_id



SELECT u.id, u.name p.id AS phone_id FROM users u LEFT JOIN
    phones p ON u.id = p.user_id
ORDER BY
    u.name DESC;
